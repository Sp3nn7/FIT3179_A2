        <h2>Global Contributions to Terrorism </h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-1">
                <div id="vis1" class="vis-container-centre"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="pure-u-1-1">
              <p2>
                Figure 1 uses a choropleth map to display each countries percentage contribution towards the global terrorism count in from 2014-2017.<br><br>
              </p2>

              <p2>
                We can see that the areas that have contributed the most to this count in this 3 year period are countries apart of or surrounding the Middle East,
                where <span class="special">Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan contributed  43%</span>  globally in this period.<br>
              </p2>
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <h2>Yearly and Monthly Trends in Global Attack Occurrences</h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-3">
                <p2>
                  Figures 2 and 3 highlight both the yearly number of attacks based on the type of attack as well as the monthly breakdown of attacks for the given year respectively. <br><br>
                </p2>

                <p2>
                  Throughout the years of 2014-2017,  <span class="special">bombings/explosions</span>  are the vehicle for most terrorist attacks in this period. <br><br>
                </p2>

                <p2>
                  What is interesting to see is that globally, the <span class="special">number of attacks seems constant</span> throughout the individual months of the year. As we use these visualizations to attempt to highlight a trend, we attempt to find a daily trend in figure 4 below.<br><br>
                </p2>
            </div>

            <div class="pure-u-1-3">
                <div id="vis2"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="pure-u-1-3">
                <div id="vis7"></div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <h2>Global Daily Terrorism Incidents</h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p2>
                  Figure 4 attempts to highlight a trend based on the specific days in the year/month. Through creating a waffle chart, we can visualize how many days in the month terrorist attacks occur. <br><br>
                </p2> 

                <p2>
                  Unfortunately, we can see that we <span class="special">do not have a single day</span> through this 3 year period where a terrorist attack hasn’t occurred. <br>
                </p2>

                <p2>
                  Because of this, we have decided to encode colour with the number of attacks on the given day. By doing this we can attempt to find if any days in particular cause an increase in terror. <br><br>
                </p2>

                <p2>
                  Unfortunately, <span class="special">no trend</span> can directly be seen from this waffle chart, where these attacks don’t appear to highlight a pattern based on a specific day in the year.<br><br>
                </p2>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <div id="vis5"></div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <h2>What is the global death toll resulting from these attacks?</h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p2>
                  As can be seen from figure 7, this boxplot describes the distribution of fatalities from terrorist attacks from 2014-2017 for specific weapon types. Throughout this period, although there have been countless terrorist attacks (refer to figures 1-5) the <span class="special">fatalities are quite low</span>, where the  <span class="special">median number of fatalities is 1</span> (per weapon categoty).<br><br>
                </p2>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <div id="vis6"></div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <h2>Which individuals or Groups are being Targeted?</h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-2-3">
                <div id="vis4" class="vis-container-centre"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-3">
              <p2>
                Figure 6 attempts to highlight which groups or people have been targeted more frequently in these attacks from 2014-2017 through a word cloud.
                This word cloud highlights key words that appear frequently throughout the dataset in order to <span class="special">deduce the frequency of attacks</span> .<br><br>
              </p2>

              <p2>
               As can be seen the <span class="special">most common targets are unknown</span>, highlighting that these attacks either have no target in mind or that
               the dataset is limited. We can also see keywords such as <span class="special">Taliban, Extremists and Iraq</span>  which agree with Figure 1's depiction of countries with high counts of terrorism.<br><br>
              </p2>
          </div>
        </div>


        <h2>Who is responsible for the terrorist attacks?
        </h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p2>
                  Figure 5 utilizes a pie chart to describe which terrorist organizations are 
                  performing attacks based on the weapon type and year.<br><br>
                </p2>

                  <p2>
                    Unfortunately, a worrying statistic that is highlighted through this visualisation is that in nearly all years and weapon types, <span class="special">unknown people/organizations are performing the most number of attacks</span>. <br><br>
